# Job-Harbor
Traditional job portals often lack the flexibility to cater to the diverse needs of both job seekers and companies. Job seekers may struggle to find opportunities that align with their preferences and career goals, while companies may face challenges in attracting qualified candidates for specific roles. Existing job platforms typically focus on either full-time employment or freelancing opportunities, overlooking the growing demand for internships and experience-based
projects. 
<br>This limited scope restricts the options available to both job seekers and companies, leading to inefficiencies and frustrations in the recruitment process. Moreover, the lack of integration between different sectors and employment types further exacerbates these challenges, making it difficult for individuals to explore diverse career paths and for companies to find suitable candidates across various fields
<br> In response to these shortcomings, Job Harbor aims to revolutionize the job market byoffering a comprehensive platform that caters to the evolving needs of both job seekers
and companies. By providing a wide range of employment opportunities and a user-friendly interface, Job Harbor seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the job search and recruitment process, ultimately empowering individuals and organizations to thrive in today's competitive landscape.


## Background Study
